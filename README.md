# Ecommerce_sales_analysis
Analyzing sales data to identify premium customers and locations with the highest delivery cost 

## Project Description
This project analyses e-commerce sales data to derive insights related to shipping costs and customer purchasing behaviour. The SQL queries included in this project help identify key metrics such as the top states with the highest shipping costs and premium customers based on their purchasing quantities.

## Database Setup
1. **Create the Database**:

2. **Load Data**:
Ensure that the `Sales_Dataset_New` table is populated with relevant sales data.

## SQL Queries

### Q1: Identify the Top Three States with the Highest Shipping Costs
This query retrieves the top three states based on the sum of shipping costs.

### Q2: Identifying Premium Customers
This query identifies customers whose total quantity purchased exceeds the average quantity purchased by all customers.

## How to Run Queries
- Use a SQL client or management tool (like SQL Server Management Studio) to connect to your SQL Server instance.
- Execute each query in the context of the `ecommerce_sales_data` database.
